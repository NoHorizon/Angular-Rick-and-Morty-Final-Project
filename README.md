# A little about my final project: Building a dynamic website with Angular

# Netlify link: https://angular-rick-and-morty-project.netlify.app

# This is my final project for `IT-STEP Academy 6-month Front-End Course`.

I would like to express my gratitude to my instructor, `Beka Baghaturia`, for his expertise and guidance throughout this 6-month Front-End Course. His dedication to teaching us the latest technologies and tools in front-end development has been invaluable to completing this project. Thank you, `Beka`, for being a true professional in your field.

In this project, I have created a website centered around the popular TV show "Rick and Morty". The website uses an API to fetch information about various characters in the show and display them in a visually appealing way using Bootstrap 5 cards and carousel.

I have also implemented routing in my application, which allows users to easily navigate between different views and pages. My website features several components, each with a specific purpose.

One of these components is a card component that displays information about a character, including their name, image, and other relevant details. To enhance the user experience, I have included a "Show Alters" button on each card. When the user clicks this button, the website displays other characters with the same first name as the one displayed on the card. This feature adds an extra layer of interactivity and engagement to the website.

Overall, my Angular project about "Rick and Morty" showcases my skills in creating dynamic and responsive web applications using the latest technologies and tools. I hope that my website provides an enjoyable and informative experience for fans of the show and users alike.

By breaking the text into smaller paragraphs and adding some whitespace, it's easier for readers to follow the flow of information and understand the different components of the project.
