      A little about my final project: Building a dynamic website with
      <span class="underline">Angular</span>
    </h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
      This is my final project for
      <span class="underline">IT-STEP Academy</span> 6-month Front-End Course.
      <br /><br />
      In this project, I have created a website centered around the popular TV
      show "Rick and Morty". The website uses an API to fetch information about
      various characters in the show and display them in a visually appealing
      way using Bootstrap 5 cards and carousel. <br /><br />
      I have also implemented routing in my application, which allows users to
      easily navigate between different views and pages. My website features
      several components, each with a specific purpose.
      <br /><br />
      One of these components is a card component that displays information
      about a character, including their name, image, and other relevant
      details. To enhance the user experience, I have included a "Show Alters"
      button on each card. When the user clicks this button, the website
      displays other characters with the same first name as the one displayed on
      the card. This feature adds an extra layer of interactivity and engagement
      to the website.
      <br /><br />
      Overall, my Angular project about "Rick and Morty" showcases my skills in
      creating dynamic and responsive web applications using the latest
      technologies and tools. I hope that my website provides an enjoyable and
      informative experience for fans of the show and users alike.
      <br /><br />
      By breaking the text into smaller paragraphs and adding some whitespace,
      it's easier for readers to follow the flow of information and understand
      the different components of the project.
      <br /><br />
      I would like to express my gratitude to my instructor,
      <span class="underline">Beka Baghaturia</span>, for his expertise and
      guidance throughout this 6-month Front-End Course. His dedication to
      teaching us the latest technologies and tools in front-end development has
      been invaluable to completing this project. Thank you,
      <span class="underline">Beka</span>, for being a true professional in your
      field.
